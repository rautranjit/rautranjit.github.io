Hi, I'm Ranjit Raut. I'm from Nepal. I've been interested in Science, Mathematics, Technology, & Philosophy since I was young, and I'm always looking for new ways to learn more about it. 

My goal is to discover something that pushes the boundaries of what's possible with the domains that I've been working on and its potential to improve the world. I'm currently working on ideas that aim to use my domain knowledge to help people in need. In my free time, I like to explore new domains, learn them, and work on projects that will impact people's lives. 

Furthermore, I spend my time observing the environment around me as I believe I can learn lots of new things from them too. Otherwise, you can find me playing indoor and outdoor games or exploring the world around me.
